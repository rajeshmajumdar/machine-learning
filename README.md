## Machine Learning

Just some random projects to get me familiar with machine learning.

### Neural Network
Implementing a basic neural network without using any framework like Tensorflow or pyTorch. It helps me understand the nuances and the mathematics that goes behind building a neural network. 

- Modules Used
> Numpy (For matrices and basic linear algebra)
> Matplotlib (To visualize the results)
> Pandas (Simply to play around with data)
