## Machine Learning

Just some random projects to get me familiar with machine learning.

> [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/rajeshmajumdar/machine-learning/blob/master/naive_bayes.py)

### [Neural Network](https://github.com/rajeshmajumdar/machine-learning/blob/master/neural_network.py)
Implementing a basic neural network without using any framework like Tensorflow or pyTorch. It helps me understand the nuances and the mathematics that goes behind building a neural network. 

- Modules Used
1. Numpy (For matrices and basic linear algebra)
2. Matplotlib (To visualize the results)
3. Pandas (Simply to play around with data)

### [Sign Language NN](https://github.com/rajeshmajumdar/machine-learning/blob/master/sign_language_nn.py)
Tried implementing the same neural network with some tweaks in the hidden and output layer. And also added some extra functions like saving and loading weights and biases.
Currently, I was able to get 70% accuracy on train_data and ~65% accuracy on test_data. I think it could be better, if I add more hidden layers in between that's for later.

Same modules used as before.

### [Neuron](https://github.com/rajeshmajumdar/machine-learning/blob/master/neuron.py)
Implementation of a basic neuron taking multiple inputs, and a layer of neurons connected to each other with 4 inputs.

First I hardcoded each neuron to better understand the nuances of a neuron and the maths goes behind it, next I used loops to make it more dynamic, so we can change the number of neurons and inputs and it could handle it

### [Tensors](https://github.com/rajeshmajumdar/machine-learning/blob/master/tensors.py)
In this I added some more complexity to our neuron, like handling multiple input vectors and some basic maths we all have learned in 11th-12th standard.
